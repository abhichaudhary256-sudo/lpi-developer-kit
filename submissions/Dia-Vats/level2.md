## LLM Configuration

LLM chosen: Mistral  
Reason: Balanced speed and performance for local execution.  
Gemma4:e2b was too slow on my system, so I switched to a lighter model.  
It handled SMILE prompt effectively without needing cloud models.

## LLM Output (SMILE Explanation)

### 1. Modeling  
We create digital models of physical assets like machines or buildings. This helps us understand and predict behavior.

### 2. Simulation  
We run simulations on these models to test behavior under different conditions and predict issues.

### 3. Integration  
We connect models with real-world sensor data so the digital twin reflects the actual system state.

### 4. Leverage  
We use the digital twin to optimize operations, predict maintenance, train staff, and improve design.

## 3 Things I Found Surprising About SMILE

1. It starts with understanding the real-world problem first, not with data or models.  
2. It is structured in clear phases where each step builds on the previous one.  
3. It prioritizes problem definition and system connection over technical complexity.
